# hitchARide
Simple webapp for pairing drivers with riders (right now for hiking purposes)
Check it out at: http://hitcharide.pythonanywhere.com/

## Planned features: 
- Code words or passwords so drivers can cancel rides
- Let riders leave rides (also using code words or passwords)
- Rides auto delete after they take place (day after or something) 
- Let driver modify rides (date, time, location)
- Recommended reimbursement per person (based on distance (about $0.1 per mile))
- Redo all the SQL to make it more efficient and better (add more tables, change commands in models.py)
- Better formatting
- Perhaps full log in system with cookies and stuff. That seems a bit unnecessary though...
