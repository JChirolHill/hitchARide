# hitchARide
Simple webapp for pairing drivers with riders (right now for hiking purposes).
Check it out at: http://hitcharide.pythonanywhere.com/

## Planned features: 
- (DONE) Code words or passwords so drivers can cancel rides
- Let riders leave rides (also using code words or passwords) (or let drivers remove them on the edit page)
- (DONE) Rides auto delete after they take place (day after or something) 
- (DONE) Let driver modify rides (date, time, location)
- Recommended reimbursement per person (based on distance (about $0.1 per mile))
- Redo all the SQL to make it more efficient and better (add more tables, change commands in models.py)
- (DONE) FAQ
- Better formatting
- Let users Filter, search, and sort the list of rides
- Perhaps full log in system with cookies and stuff. That seems a bit unnecessary though...

We are so glad you want to help! Right now, the site is in a proof of concept stage so the code is a bit of a mess. Given this goes well, it will be updated to a more scalable design. After the update, we welcome your contributions. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/mes258/hitcharide">source code.</a> Please submit your ideas as an issue and we'll update this section when we are open to pull requests.
