# hitchARide
Simple webapp for pairing drivers with riders (right now for hiking purposes).
Check it out at: http://hitcharide.pythonanywhere.com/

## Planned features: 
- (DONE) Code words or passwords so drivers can cancel rides
- (DONE) Let riders leave rides (also using code words or passwords) (or let drivers remove them on the edit page)
- (DONE) Rides auto delete after they take place (day after or something) 
- (DONE) Let driver modify rides (date, time, location)
- Recommended reimbursement per person (based on distance (about $0.1 per mile))
- (DONE, maybe) Redo all the SQL to make it more efficient and better (add more tables, change commands in models.py)
- (DONE) FAQ
- Better formatting
- Let users Filter, search, and sort the list of rides
- Perhaps full log in system with cookies and stuff. That seems a bit unnecessary though...
- Hike reviews
- Show popular hikes when the user is typing in a destination name
